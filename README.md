# Working-of-the-LED-using-LDR

Hi,                            
Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project that i made.


## LDR 

LDR stands for Light Dependent Resistor or Photoresistor, which is a passive electronic
component, basically a resistor which has a resistance that varies depending of the light intensity.

### Observation:
As you could observe in the uploaded video the LED starts glowing as soon as the shadow 
approaches the Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) and LED extinguishes as the shadow gets away and 
light starts falling  on the LDR.

#### Explanation:

It happens because as the LDR gets light on it, its resistance increases and it does not allow 
the voltage to go further. In case of night or shadow the LDR's resistance decreases and the LED 
starts glowing. 
                                  
                                                          
## COMPONENTS USED
1)LED                                                                            
2)Transistor- BC547                                                               
3)Light Dependent Resistor(LDR)                                                                
4)Resistor- 50kohm , 1kohm                                                                                                          
(If you dont have 50k ohm resistor, you can also use 2 resistor in series of 25k ohm)
5) Batter-9v                                                     
6) Few jumper wires
