# Working-of-the-LED-using-LDR

Hi,                            
Shubh this side, I am here to give a bit of description about the project that i made.


## LDR 

LDR stands for Light Dependent Resistor or Photoresistor, which is a passive electronic
component, basically a resistor which has a resistance that varies depending of the light intensity.

### Observation:
As you could observe in the uploaded video the LED starts glowing as soon as the shadow 
approaches the Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) and LED extinguishes as the shadow gets away and 
light starts falling  on the LDR.

#### Explanation:

It happens because as the LDR gets light on it, its resistance increases and it does not allow 
the voltage to go further. In case of night or shadow the LDR's resistance decreases and the LED 
starts glowing. 
                                  
#### Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) Applications:


The important applications of LDR are,

1. LDRs are used in Light Sensors

2. LDR is also used in some cameras to detect the presence of the light.

3. LDRs are used Ligh Intensity measurement meters.

4. In the manufacturing industry, LDR is used as a sensor for the counting of the packets moving on a conveyor belt.

5. LDRs are also used in Light Activated Control Circuits.

6. LDRs are used in Street Lights which are automatically turn ON in the night time.                                  
                                  
                                                          
## COMPONENTS USED
1)LED                                                                            
2)Transistor- BC547                                                               
3)Light Dependent Resistor(LDR)                                                                
4)Resistor- 50kohm , 1kohm                                                                                                          
(If you dont have 50k ohm resistor, you can also use 2 resistor in series of 25k ohm)                                   
5) Batter-9v                                                     
6) Few jumper wires
